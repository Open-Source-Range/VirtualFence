  The Virtual Fence system consists of two devices that are used to contain
  Cows in a defined area.  The first device, a beacon, is used to define a
  fenced area, the second device, a BuzzZap, is used to control the Cow.
  
  
  
  Beacons/fence posts
    - placed at intervals (min/max distance) to define a "fenced" area
    - detect when a Cow is nearing the "fence line"
      - 
    - Buzz the Cow as it gets near the line
    - Zap the Cow if it continues to get closer
    - store the data/information
    - reply to status and data requests from Base Station
    - communication protocol
      - one node is "FenceNet Manager"
        - protocol specifies how to correct/respond if manager node fails
        - manager discovers all nodes in fencenet
          - detects failed nodes
          - detects added nodes
      - More protocol requirements . . . .

  BuzzZap device
    - circuitry that allows the Beacon to determine distance to the BuzzZap device
      - transponder that repeats a pulse sent to it from a beacon
        - many (>10) roundtrip delay times can be averaged to determine distance
    - listens for commands from Beacons
      - Buzz Cow
      - Zap Cow
      - who are you? (respond with Cow ID and any other info)
        



Should Beacon have 2 antennas a large enough distance apart to
allow an individual beacon to determine which side of the fence
the Cow/BuzzZap is?



  Target cost is < $5,000 for beacon system to cover at least 10,000 acres
  and <$15 per BuzzZap device.
    - beacon cost ~ $5
